changing from one data type to another...(Type casting)....
I need to convert strings to integer...
2 steps:
a. parseInt();
b. +();

parseInt: is used to convert strings to integer..
variable:var, let and const..
Strings: strings are used as it is ...
Array:
// Comment
// the purpose is to understand what is the code is doing

//Inbuilt methods:
// split();
// it is used to convert string to character array..
var str = "1 2 3 4".split(" ");
console.log(str);
var res = str.map(Number);
console.log(res);

// Comment
// the purpose is to understand what is the code is doing

//Inbuilt methods:
// split();
// it is used to convert string to character array..
var str = "1 2 3 4".split(" ");
console.log(str);
var res = str.map(Number);
console.log(res);

// Chaining of Methods...
var arr = "1 2 3 4".split(" ").map(Number);
console.log(arr);
[1,2,3,4]

Read The array from the keyword, and print only the even num
mbers from the array

Input: 1 2 3 4 5
output:2 4
// 5 steps
// Step 1: convert input string to numbers array
// step 3: Apply for loop for the array
// Step 2: Take a Temprorpy array
// Step 4: push the even numbers into the temproray array
// Step 5: Apply Join Method
var arr = "1 2 3 4".split(" ").map(Number);
// Step 2: Take a Temprorpy array
var temp = []
// step 3: Apply for loop for the array
for(var i =0;i<arr.length;i++){
if(arr[i]%2==0){
// Step 4: push the even numbers into the temproray arr
temp.push(arr[i]);
}
}
// Step 5: Apply Join Method
console.log(temp.join(" "));

Absolute Beginner:
The area of an equilateral triangle is ¼(√3a2) where "a" represents a side of the triangle. You are provided with the side "a". Find the area of the equilateral triangle.

Input Description:
The side of an equilateral triangle is provided as the input.

Output Description:
Find the area of the equilateral triangle and print the answer up to 2 decimal places after rounding off.

Sample Input :
20
Sample Output :
173.21

var num = parseInt(userInput[0]);
var area = Math.sqrt(3)*num*num/4;
console.log(area.toFixed(2));

3.You are provided with the radius of a circle "A". Find the length of its circumference.

Note: In case the output is coming in decimal, roundoff to 2nd decimal place. In case the input is a negative number, print "Error".

Input Description:
The Radius of a circle is provided as the input of the program.

Output Description:
Calculate and print the Circumference of the circle corresponding to the input radius up to two decimal places.

Sample Input :
2
Sample Output :
12.57

var num = parseFloat(userInput[0]);
if(num<0){
    console.log("Error")
}
else{
   var area = 2 * Math.PI*num;
console.log(area.toFixed(2)) 
}


You are given the coefficients of a quadratic equation in order A, B & C.

Where A is the coefficient of X2,  B is the coefficient of X and C is the constant term in the most simplified form.

Example: For  X2 + 5X + 6 = 0, you are given the input as: 1 5 6.

Write a program to find all of the roots of the quadratic.

Note: The output should be up to 2nd decimal place (round off if needed) and in case of a recurring decimal use braces i.e. for eg: 0.33333..... => 0.33.

Note: Use Shri Dharacharya's Method to solve i.e. X = {-b + √(b² - 4ac) } / 2a & {-b-√(b² -4ac)} / 2a

Input Description:
Three numbers corresponding to the coefficients of x(squared), x and constant are given as an input in that particular order

Output Description:
Print the two values of X after rounding off to 2 decimal places if required.

Sample Input :
1 5 6
Sample Output :
-2.00
-3.00




var arr = userInput[0].split(" ");
var a =parseFloat(arr[0]);
var b = parseFloat(arr[1]);
var c= parseFloat(arr[2]);
var discriminant = Math.sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c);
var res1 = (-b+discriminant)/(2*a)
var res2 = (-b-discriminant)/(2*a)
console.log(res1.toFixed(2));
console.log(res2.toFixed(2));
